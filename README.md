This repository contains the `streamscout` front-end project.

Quick actions:

- Local repo initialization and initial commit were created by an assistant.
- To create a GitHub repo and push, follow the instructions below.

How to push to GitHub (recommended):

1. Create a remote repository on GitHub (via the website or `gh repo create`).
2. Add the remote and push:

   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   git push -u origin main

If you want the assistant to create the GitHub repo and push automatically, install and authenticate the GitHub CLI (`gh`) and re-run the push step.

Notes:
- If Git commit fails due to missing user.name/email, set them with `git config`.
- Sensitive files are ignored if placed in `.env`.
